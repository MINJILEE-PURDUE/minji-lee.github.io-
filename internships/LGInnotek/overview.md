#### Transitioning from Sequential to Parallel Processing in Manufacturing
- This document explains the mathematical principles behind transitioning from sequential processing to parallel processing in manufacturing environments.
- It includes efficiency comparisons, key concepts like speedup, and practical applications such as minimizing the gap between process and operational data using Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence.


# Transitioning from Sequential to Parallel Processing

## Sequential Processing
The total processing time for sequential execution is:

`T_sequential = sum(t_i)`

## Parallel Processing
The total processing time for parallel execution is determined by the longest task:

`T_parallel = max(t_1, t_2, ..., t_n)`

## Speedup
The speedup achieved by parallelism is calculated as:

`S = T_sequential / T_parallel`
