#### Transitioning from Sequential to Parallel Processing in Manufacturing
Manufacturing companies like LG Innotek handle extremely large datasets, such as high-resolution images for camera modules or semiconductor inspection. These datasets require efficient processing methods to ensure high throughput and precision. Traditionally, sequential processing is used, where tasks are executed one after another. However, this approach can become a bottleneck when handling massive data volumes.

To overcome this, parallel processing can be implemented, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously. The transition from sequential to parallel processing involves understanding the trade-offs between processing speed, resource utilization, and system complexity. Mathematical models like speedup calculations, Amdahl's Law, and load balancing equations help optimize this transition. Additionally, techniques such as Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence are used to minimize discrepancies between process data and operational data, ensuring alignment and efficiency.

Below, we describe the mathematical principles underlying this transition.
